I'm running Tapanila.net on Windows Azure Websites and using Wordpress. The biggest reason why I chose Wordpress and why I'm still using it is the amount of themes, plugins and services available for it. I use a lot of different services on my blog and here's a list of them:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> - DNS</li>
	<li><a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus </a>- Commenting</li>
	<li><a href="http://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a> - All pictures on my blog are hosted on cloudinary. I upload full sized pictures into their service and it  resize them to perfectly fit my blog layout</li>
	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist </a>- Sharing my source code samples</li>
	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/starbox/">Starbox</a> - Author box in bottom of my posts</li>
	<li><a href="http://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid </a>- Takes care of all the emails my blog sends</li>
	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP SuperCache -</a> Caching my Wordpress</li>
</ul>
If you have any questions regarding any of the services that I use or why did I choose these just ask on comments.
