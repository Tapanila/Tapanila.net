I have built C# Chromecast SDK that allows you to control chromecast from Windows & Windows Phone applications.
<!--more-->

You can find the sdk from [here](https://github.com/tapanila/SharpCaster)

The project includes the SDK and sample application that show you how you can use the SDK.

I created this library because I have been annoyed with the usage of Chromecast. You can't use it all on Windows Phone and to use it on your laptop you have to launch the applications web version on chrome and then you can start casting. Not anymore!

SDK is currently on beta phase. Which means I'm doing pretty major changes on it without thinking about backward compatibility or update path.

If you have any questions or want to start using this on your application I would be more than happy to talk with you!

P.S. I'm currently aiming to support Media playing features. If there's some of the chromecast API calls that are not currently supported. Drop me a line and I can fix it!
