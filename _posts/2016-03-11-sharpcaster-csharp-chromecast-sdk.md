I have built C# Chromecast SDK that allows you to control chromecast from Windows & Windows Phone applications.
<!--more-->

You can find the SDK from [github](https://github.com/tapanila/SharpCaster)


The project includes the SDK and sample application that show you how you can use the SDK.


If you have any questions or want to start using this on your application I would be more than happy to talk with you!
