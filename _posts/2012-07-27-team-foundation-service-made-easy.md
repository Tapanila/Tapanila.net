Team Foundation Server has been something that you mostly see in bigger companies.
Because it required a hosted solution to work well.
So if you wanted to have a TFS even for a small team project you would need to get access to hosted TFS or first spend few days installing it. Now there's a very easy option Team Foundation Service.


1. Open [tfspreview.com](http://tfspreview.com/en-us/)

   ![Register](https://res.cloudinary.com/tapanila-net/image/upload/w_610,q_100/v1388360866/Register_tr2wdf.png)
2. Fill in wanted name (Try to choose something that's easy to remember)

   ![Registering form](https://res.cloudinary.com/tapanila-net/image/upload/w_610,q_100/v1388360865/Create_sf6oz5.png)
3. Login with your Windows Live ID
4. Your TFS is now ready

5. Start by creating a new project. You only need to type the name and choose the template. The default one is good.
