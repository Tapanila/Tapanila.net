Ever wanted to use private repository for GitHub? If you are a student you can get it for free atÂ <a href="https://github.com/edu">https://github.com/edu
<!--more--></a>

After you have entered to the website you only need fill in quick form and then you will get answer back from GitHub. They are asking this information:
<ul>
	<li>School name</li>
	<li>Year in school</li>
	<li>How you are going to use GitHub?</li>
</ul>
Also to speed up the process it's recommended that you add your school official email to your github account and verify it.
