<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">MVVM</a> is coding pattern that I like a lot. There's a lot of people who say it isn't so good but for Windows Phone and Windows 8 coding I find it perfect. MVVM comes from Model - View - ViewModel and the main idea is to separate data structure, logic and views.

I have found it especially powerful when creating application that in future will be ported to another platform/updated. Example when you are creating WP8 project you might want to port it to Windows 8 too in near future. Also if you are friend of Data Binding then this pattern is totally for you!

<a href="http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/">MVVM Light Toolkit</a> is package that will help you get started with MVVM very easily and very fast. So if you want to get started with it just download it from <a href="http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/">codeplex</a> or get it from <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/MvvmLight">NuGet</a> and <a href="http://jesseliberty.com/2011/01/04/wpfs-mvvm-light-toolkit-soup-to-nuts-part-i/">here</a> is great starting point in your journey into MVVM.
